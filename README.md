This research investigates how the three variables (dataset size, hidden layer size, iteration number) influences the performance of the neural network for stereo ranging.
The neural_network_test_trial.py exemplifies one trial of neural network training using fixed parameters.
The other three .py files separately tests the performance of the neural network by taking different values of the three variables.
To show how does the generation of the dataset works, the dataset generated by one execution of the neural_network_test_trial.py is in dataset.csv.
